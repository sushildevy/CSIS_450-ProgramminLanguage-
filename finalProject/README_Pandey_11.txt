The file Front.java is just the java conversion of c implementation of file front.cpp along with operators.
In this assignment, we added binary operators and assignment operators. 

for Front.java:
In Front.java, part that support new EBNF is commented out (i.e expr() function is not called in main but I have done in RDParser2)
To compile the file, first user should open the terminal on smaug.
Then user have to reach the file direcrory where .java file is located using cd space direcrory name.(here the file path is already set though)
To comiple the java file, user should type javac filename.java after they reach the file directory.(Here filename is Front, so Front.java) 
To run the gererated class file, type java fileName (here file name is Front)
 

for RDParser2.java:
RDParser2 is very similar with Front.java but it support the EBNF
To compile the file, first user should open the terminal on smaug.
Then user have to reach the file direcrory where .java file is located using cd space direcrory name.(here the file path is already set though)
To comiple the java file, user should type javac filename.java after they reach the file directory.(Here filename is Front, so RDParser2.java) 
To run the gererated class file, type java fileName (here file name is RDParser2)
