The file Front.java is just the java conversion of c implementation of file front.cpp along with some operators.
In this assignment, we added binary operators and assignment operators. 


To compile the file, first you should opent the terminal on smaug.


Then user have to reach the file direcrory where .java file is located using cd space direcrory name.(here the file path is already set though)


To comiple the java file, user should type javac filename.java after they reach the file directory.(Here filename is RDParser2, so RDParser2.java) 


To run the gererated class file, type java fileName (here file name is RDParser2)
